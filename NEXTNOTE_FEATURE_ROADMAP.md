### **ðŸš© NextNote: Integrated Development Roadmap ðŸ§­**

#### **[PHASE 1: SOLIDIFYING THE OFFLINE CORE]**
*(Objective: Evolve from a single-file prototype to a robust, high-performance offline application.)*

* **[CORE INFRASTRUCTURE]**
    * `[ ]` **Upgrade Storage Backend:** Migrate from `localStorage` to `IndexedDB` for high-performance, large-scale storage of notes and attachments.
    * `[x]` **Refine Code Organization:** Split the current single HTML file into separate `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files for better maintainability.
    * `[x]` **Attachment/Resource Manager:** Base system complete. Needs upgrade to use `IndexedDB` instead of base64 in `localStorage`.
    * `[x]` **Multi-Notebook Support:** Implement the ability to create, open, and switch between different notebooks (self-contained databases within `IndexedDB`).
    * `[x]` **Autosave & Versioning:** Implement a reliable autosave mechanism.
        * `[x]` **Advanced:** Track page history/snapshots for version control.

* **[EXISTING CORE FEATURES - COMPLETE]**
    * `[x]` **Section/Page Tree:** Core UI with drag-and-drop is functional.
    * `[x]` **Editor:** Quill WYSIWYG with Markdown conversion is implemented.
    * `[x]` **Theme Engine:** Hermes, Phoenix, Dark, Light themes are operational.
    * `[x]` **Basic I/O:** Export/Import single Markdown files and insert base64 images.
    * `[x]` **Metadata:** Per-page creation/modification timestamps and GUIDs are in place.
    * `[x]` **Search:** Fuzzy search across all content with Fuse.js is functional.

#### **[PHASE 2: ENHANCING THE USER EXPERIENCE]**
*(Objective: Build out the features that make the application powerful and delightful to use daily.)*

* **[UP NEXT - HIGH PRIORITY]**
    * `[x]` **Quick Actions & Hotkeys:**
        * `[x]` Implement a Command Palette (e.g., Ctrl+P or Ctrl+K) to quickly jump to pages, apply templates, or execute commands.
        * `[x]` Establish keyboard shortcuts for common actions (new page, save, toggle preview, etc.).
    * `[ ]` **Customization:**
        * `[x]` Add per-section and per-page color selection.
        * `[ ]` Add icon selection for sections/pages.
        * `[ ]` Create an advanced settings panel for user preferences, theme customization, and plugin management.
    * `[ ]` **Templates:**
        * `[ ]` Develop a system for creating and applying page templates.
        * `[ ]` Allow for custom metadata fields per page or section (e.g., status, priority, tags).

* **[AESTHETICS & ACCESSIBILITY]**
    * `[ ]` **UI Skins:** Introduce UI variations like Rounded/Square corners or Compact/Cozy spacing.
    * `[ ]` **Accessibility Features:** Implement dedicated modes for dyslexia (e.g., using OpenDyslexic font), high-contrast, and clear day/night toggles.

#### **[PHASE 3: DESKTOP & ECOSYSTEM INTEGRATION]**
*(Objective: Break NextNote out of the browser and establish it as a true desktop application and knowledge-capture tool.)*

* **[DESKTOP APPLICATION]**
    * `[ ]` **Package for Desktop:** Wrap the web application using **Tauri** (recommended for smaller, faster app) or Electron.
        * `[ ]` This enables file system access, turning NextNote into a first-class citizen on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

* **[ECOSYSTEM & PLUGINS]**
    * `[ ]` **Web Clipper:** Create a browser extension (e.g., for Chrome/Firefox) to capture articles, bookmarks, and selections directly into a NextNote "Inbox".
    * `[ ]` **Plugin API:** Design a stable API to allow for community-developed plugins (e.g., new UI panels, custom export formats, integrations).

#### **[PHASE 4: CLOUD SYNC & DATA MOBILITY]**
*(Objective: Enable seamless, secure, multi-device synchronization and robust data import/export.)*

* **[CLOUD SYNC]**
    * `[ ]` **Implement Cloud Storage Sync:**
        * `[ ]` **Step 1: Authentication:** Integrate OAuth 2.0 for Google Drive, OneDrive, and Box.com.
        * `[ ]` **Step 2: Core Sync Logic:** Develop the mechanism to sync notes (as individual files) to a dedicated `/Apps/NextNote/` folder in the user's chosen cloud service.
        * `[ ]` **Step 3: Conflict Resolution:** Build a system to handle cases where notes are edited on multiple devices while offline (e.g., creating a "conflicted copy").

* **[ROBUST IMPORT / EXPORT]**
    * `[ ]` **Notebook Export:**
        * `[ ]` Export entire notebook (all sections, pages, settings, and attachments) as a single `.zip` file or a comprehensive `.json` file.
        * `[ ]` Export notebook to static HTML for sharing.
        * `[ ]` Export notebook to PDF (e.g., using a library like `html2pdf.js`).
    * `[ ]` **Migration Paths (Import):**
        * `[ ]` Develop importers for competitor formats like Evernote (`.enex`).
        * `[ ]` Improve HTML import capabilities.
        * `[ ]` Offer partial support for importing from OneNote (via its HTML export).
