Tools for TSDs on the USDA/FS/IIA/ICAM contract

This repository includes experimental HTML and JavaScript files for the **NextNote** proof-of-concept. See `NEXTNOTE_FEATURE_ROADMAP.md` for the current feature roadmap and TODO list.

Run `npm install` and `npm start` to launch a simple Express server that hosts `NextNote_v4_fixed.html`.

Recent additions include per-page metadata (GUID, timestamps), a fuzzy search bar powered by Fuse.js, and an attachment manager for storing images or files per notebook.
